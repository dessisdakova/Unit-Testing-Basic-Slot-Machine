# Slot Machine Game / Unit Testing

This project is a slot machine game created as a learning exercise, heavily inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I) by Tim Ruscica ([Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim)). While the core logic and concept are based on his video, I've made modifications and enhancements to the code, including restructuring it into a package, adding extensive unit tests, and improving overall code quality.
